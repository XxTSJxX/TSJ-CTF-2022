# w4nn4cryp7

Oh nyo! TSJ's PC has been infected by the w4nn4cryp7 malware! Hopefully, TSJ created a dump file for malware analysts to investigate. Can you help TSJ recover his infected C drive?

***NOTE 1: encoder.exe IS A REAL MALWARE! PLEASE SOLVE THIS CHALLENGE IN A VIRTUAL MACHINE ENVIRONMENT!!!***

Note 2: The flag is ASCII art, and it is hidden in one of the files in TSJ's C drive.
